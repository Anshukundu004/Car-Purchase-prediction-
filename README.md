 ## Logistic Regression for Car Purchase Prediction 🚗💰

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project applies **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a person will purchase a car based on their **age and salary**. The dataset is preprocessed, split into training and test sets, and then used to train a **Logistic Regression model**.

## 🚀 Features  
- Uses **Logistic Regression** for binary classification  
- Performs **feature scaling** for better model performance  
- Includes **data visualization** of training and test set results  
- Evaluates model accuracy using a **confusion matrix**  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Scikit-learn** (Logistic Regression, Train/Test Split, Feature Scaling)  
- **Pandas** (Data Preprocessing)  
- **Matplotlib** (Visualization)  
- **NumPy** (Numerical Computation)
